- ECR repository setup for container image storage
- ECS Fargate cluster and service configuration through AWS Console
- Application Load Balancer and target groups manual setup
- IAM roles creation for ECS task execution
- Local Docker image build and push to ECR using AWS CLI
- Book App deployed and accessible via ALB DNS name

#### Standard CI/CD Pipeline
- CloudFormation templates for automated CodePipeline setup
- CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy integration
- Automated rolling updates to existing ECS service
- Pipeline triggers on code commits for continuous deployment

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- CloudFormation templates for blue-green deployment pipeline

## Project 5 : AWS Serverless Stock Trading Platform
The AWS Serverless Stock Trading Platform is a fully cloud-native, serverless application designed to simulate real-time stock trading. It is built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Amazon S3, and CloudFront, offering users a fast, scalable, and cost-effective trading interface accessible through a responsive web UI.

**Goal**:
Combine Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with manual provisioning to enable a flexible deployment strategy for a Three-Tier Web Application on AWS.

**Implementation**:
- CloudFormation templates used to deploy core infrastructure:
- VPC with public/private subnets
- Route tables, internet/NAT gateways
- Security groups for controlled access
- Aurora MySQL cluster provisioned using CloudFormation for the data tier
- Manual provisioning of EC2 instances for the web and app tiers within the pre-created VPC
- Frontend and backend applications deployed and configured on EC2 instances
- Database connectivity tested and verified between backend EC2 and Aurora MySQL
- Environment variables and security groups configured to allow seamless integration

**Outcome**:
A hybrid deployment model that combines the reliability and repeatability of Infrastructure as Code with the flexibility of manual provisioning, showcasing real-world deployment workflows for a traditional three-tier architecture on AWS.
